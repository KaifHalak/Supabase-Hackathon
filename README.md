# Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension helps users track their productivity by analyzing their video-watching behavior and overall productivity using AI and JavaScript.
It monitors when users pause or skip through videos to ensure that non-productive time isn’t counted towards their total watch time.
Additionally, it features a leaderboard that ranks users based on their productivity, awarding points for productive behavior.

## How It Works

- **AI-Powered Productivity Analysis**: The extension uses AI to assess whether the user's current actions (watching, pausing, skipping) are productive. This helps ensure that only productive time contributes to the user’s score.

- **Accurate Watch Time Tracking**: By tracking video interactions, the extension accurately records active watch time, ignoring moments when the user pauses or skips parts of the video.

- **Compete on the Leaderboard**: Users can compare their productivity scores with others on a leaderboard, which ranks participants based on their productivity points.
